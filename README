REVERSE SPACE INVADERS
48-hour GameJam
Theme: Destroy the Future

Game:
        Play as an alien mother-ship as you spawn in various ships in hopes to
        destroy the puny humans. As you progress, the levels become increasingly
        difficult and the prices of ships gets higher and higher.

How to play:
        The game begins paused and starts off with one enemy. Be warned, the
        levels get increasingly more difficult as you kill more enemies. You
        can buy the ships listed in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen
        by using 'q', 'w', 'e', 'r', or 't'; the first five levels unlock each
        ship. Finally, use 'p' to pause the game and strategize a formation to
        kill the humans!

Ships:
        Allied:
                1. Fighter
                2. Wall
                3. Healer
                4. Laser
                5. Missile

        Enemy

                3. Enemy Fighter

Future Improvements:
        - Move the sprite updates to a multi-threaded process to reduce update
        lag in later stages.
        - Add an end, not just go until you die.
        - High score list
        - Make ships so they can not be spawned directly overlapping each other
        - Background movement at the end of each level.
